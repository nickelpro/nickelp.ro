The layout for my homepage requires there be a few blog posts to display,
otherwise it's all unbalanced. In the spirit of generating content for the
purpose of generating content, I'm going to try to write up something
interesting every day for the next few days. Or at least until my homepage
is filled. Today the subject is my nightstand.

Maybe having _Sex Criminals_ and _Necrophilia Variations_ center stage wasn't
wise. Sue me.

It has completely failed to function as a nightstand very nearly from the day
I bought it. It's not a great bookshelf either to be honest, but we make do
with what we have. The point I'm trying to make here is it's covered in comic
books, and a few loose pieces of prose that got lost. I love comic books and I
hope that if you're reading this, maybe by the end I can convince you to pick
one up yourself.

## A Brief Introduction

Where to even begin? We have a unique opertunity here, it's much easier to
wax poetic about comics in writing than in person. Comics are inherently
a visual medium, and you know the old saying about pictures.
