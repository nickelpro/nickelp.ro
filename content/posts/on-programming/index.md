This is just some dumb shit I've been musing on, but I think it might be
healthy to type up some of these errant streams of consciousness. My normal
process is to force these thoughts on some
[FNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FNG_syndrome) on my boat, who has no choice
but to sit their and listen to my infinite wisdom, lest he upset me and I curse
him into endless [dinq](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dinq)-ness.

Today I'm thinking about programming, and why people who want to learn
programming are among the worst learners in history. If you're a programmer
yourself this post will come across as obvious or pretentious, depending on
how you feel about the topic.

## Background

Learning programming is hard. That's not an opinion, there's a lot of well
established literature around the fact that _Intro to Computer Science_
students seem to fail at staggering rates. [^1]

{{< img src="failure" >}}
Note that _practical_ skills are the problem, we're not talking about
grasping academic topics
{{< /img >}}

Historically this phenomenon has been called _"the camel has two humps"_, after
a line from an unpublished and now unpopular paper from 2006. The data doesn't
seem to bear out that _Intro_ courses display a larger bi-modal distribution
than introductory courses of other fields. However, students definitely drop
out of _Intro_ more than other fields. [^2]

{{< img src="dropouts" >}}
**W** represents drop outs,
[correlation doesn't imply causation](https://xkcd.com/552/)
{{< /img >}}

Thus ends the section of this blog post with anything resembling science or
facts. Now enter wild conjecture and speculation, I propose that as a creative
pursuit programming is harder than most other fields that have come before it
in human history. I further propose that the usual approaches of self-teaching
programming are antithetical to productive knowledge, and if you want to learn
to program you should build a video game. Let's go.

## Programming is Art

[Leaving aside the usual question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classificatory_disputes_about_art),
programming inarguably demonstrates some key aspects we associate with creative
pursuits. One I'd like to touch on quickly is _coding style_, a source of
endless debate among programmers. I hesistantly offer up this screenshot of my
editor. You don't need to know anything about code, just get a visual
impression.

{{< img src="mycode" >}}

{{< /img >}}

I'd like you to compare that to some code in the same programming language
from my good friend Alex.

{{< img src="alexcode" >}}
This is from a program that does not draw a square
{{< /img >}}

We see a large contrast between styles here. I value high information density,
struggling to hold in my head what I cannot see on the screen. In order to
manage and organize this writhing mess, I've configured my editor to
_semantically_ highlight the code. This hijacks the [brain's visual processing
pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_neuroscience_of_visual_object_recognition)
and allows sufficiently maladjusted people like me to navigate the code the
same way most people can identify different ingredients in a fruit salad.

Alex exists at the opposite end of the spectrum, his dominant organization
pattern is _spatial_. When I send Alex code to review, the first thing he does
is carefully read each statement and insert blanks every few lines. This
process of organization gives him the information he needs about the program,
similar to knowing the contents of the drawers and cabinets of your house by
having each collect a related group of objects.

Both Alex and I are achieving the same thing. We're using established cognitive
pathways to map **code** to an **internal model of computation**. That internal
model is where I believe many people struggle.

## Code is Not Programming

Imagine for a minute, an aspiring writer trying to develop her skills and
eventually publish a novel. She does lots of research, buys a typewriter with
great reviews, settles down with a dictionary and a thesaurus, and begins to
type every single word in the English language. As she types she looks up the
words in the thesaurus, and learns all the relationships and colloquialisms.
She studies grammatical rules in the evenings, and maintains decent penmanship
in case she ever needs it.

What effect will this have on the quality of the writer's novel?

{{< img src="writer" >}}
I'm uncomfortable not having a picture every few paragraphs
{{< /img >}}

Consider a second author who spends the same amount of time reading great works
of literature, and writing her own stories.

Who's novel will be better?

If you think the example is contrived, this is _exactly_ how many online
tutorials teach people to program. They focus on the tools of the trade to the
complete exclusion of _the trade itself_. With programming, _the trade_ is
**computation**, and a consistent **internal model of computation** is
necessary to build non-trivial programs.

New-comers to programming frequently ask questions about how to do impossible
or near-impossible things. Their lack of an internal model means they don't
have the ability to even put _bounds_ on their problem. A comparison would be
an apprentice carpenter asking which saw to use to bind two pieces of wood
together.

## Programming is Different

Why doesn't the carpenter need an internal model of wood? Or writers of story?
Why don't we talk about artists needing an internal model of
[cubism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubism)?

{{< img src="cubism" >}}
Picasso mapped **people** to an **internal model of cubes**
{{< /img >}}

Because each and every one of us already has those models. They don't need to
be developed from scratch, "merely" refined from their amateur state.

The written word is a couple millenia old, art a couple millenia older than
that. Jury is out on what came first, grammatical language or story telling,
but probably story telling. Physics has a basis in human experience, so does
math, chemistry, biology, and most other scientific fields.

Which is to say you already understand these things, at some extremely basic
level at least, along with everyone else for all of recorded history. A student
of art might find the style and tastes of a layman to be _bad_ or _simple_ but
the layman still **has** tastes. A newcomer to computer programming lacks even
these foundational elements, because to have taste they would have to know what
the hell it is they're looking at.

## How to Learn Programming

Despite all that whinging, I don't believe learning to program is any sort of
herculean feat. I just wouldn't advise ever reading a programming textbook
cover to cover. The goal of the beginner programmer should always be the
development of practical, useful programs. These programs will rarely
accomplish what they were originally planned to do, but in the process of
failing beginners will place the cornerstones of intuition necessary to
succeed.

A carpentry apprentice doesn't aimlessly cut wood, he purposefully
attempts to build furniture and learns in the process of failure. My only piece
of practical advice in this entire post is that video games are great
pieces of software to fail at building, because they cover a wide swath of
programming challenges and you get to have some fun along the way.

{{< img src="carpentry" >}}

{{< /img >}}

Every question must be relentlessly pursued to ground, assumptions should be
constantly challenged. Students should never accept "because that's the way it
is", the most they should allow is "we'll get to it later". Reason being,
false foundations lead to those impossible questions, an inability to frame
problems and their solution space.

Professional programmers don't do this of course, they happily accept black
boxes the same way soccer moms accept that their vans go _vroom_ when they push
the accelerator. The difference is the professional programmer has already
developed her _intuition_, she already has a consistent **internal model of
computation**, and therefore can make reasonable guesses about how any given
black box works. Just like we can make reasonable guesses, broadly, about how
the accelerator in the van works.

When a beginner finds she's naturally making those kinds of abstractions about
how computing works, she is no longer a complete beginner and can proudly call
herself a rank amateur.

## Conclusion

This whole piece is kinda crap, if you've read this far I want you to know I
recognize that. I vaguely point out that new programmers have a hard time,
make a gonzo claim about why, and offer two and a half paragraphs of solution.

The point I was trying to get across was simply this, learn how computers work
before trying to "master" a programming language. The best way to learn how
computers work is to write a lot of code and ask a lot of questions, and be
relentless in your pursuit of answers. Everything else is shit or product
placement.
